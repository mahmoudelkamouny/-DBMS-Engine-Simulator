                                Important Notes
1-you have to run dbApp.init when u start the program to load important vectors (you have to run it one time only)
2- after finishing insertion call method update_trees_after_insert to updates trees other than clustering one if exists 
because handling all btrees refrences inside insertion makes it to slow but
update and delete handles all refrences in it.
3-Btrees and Rtrees are serialised in the desk and duplicates are handleled
using overflow vectors and its also saved on the desk by the key name like 
(overflow of 10).
